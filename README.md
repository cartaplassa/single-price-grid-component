## My process

1) Built a simple mockup with borders
2) Tuned the behavior of mobile and desktop versions of cards with flexbox
3) Tuned the colors and styling, added custom font
4) Wrote the script for the "Sign Up" button

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first website built from the ground up. I've learnt how to link CSS stylesheets and JS scripts. I've also learnt how to make adaptive UI and access UI element properties on the go.

### Useful resources

- [CSS box-shadow generator](https://cssgenerator.org/box-shadow-css-generator.html) - This helped me w/ styling the outer shadow of the card
- [Adobe color wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) - A great tool I've used to find complementary colors to make hover effect for the button
- [Flex cheatsheet](https://yoksel.github.io/flex-cheatsheet/) - This helped me a lot w/ setting up flexbox
